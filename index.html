        <h1>Victoria Contreras</h1>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring Web-Developer living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with my partner and my many plants. 
            I have lived in many different states and held jobs in a variety of fields struggling trying to figure out where I belong.
            Picking a career for the rest of my life felt daunting since I love to learn many different things and I can deep dive 
            into many topics with a curious mind. When I realized Web-Development was an option for me I finally felt like I found
            something that matches up with my aspirations. <br>
            I'm enrolled in Digital Crafts PT Web-Development course to strengthen my skills, collaborate with other future developers
            and hit the job market with a competitive portfolio. You can find my current projects and find out how to reach my in the 
            <a href="#contact">Contact Me</a> section.

            <div class="bubble">
                <h3>Monstera Adonsonii</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the first plant in my life that I hadn't killed! I named her Addie because my partner likes to name plants
                    and
                    kept bugging me for a name, at the time I was reading 'The Invisible Life of Addie Laurue'.
                    She is now over a year old and has grown from one vine and two leaves to two feet tall since I learned how to
                    propogate!

                    <h3>Monstera Deliciosa</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is my newest plant. She is my dream plant that I promised myself I would get if I kept Addie alive for a year.
                        My dream is to one day have a green house in my backyard where they can grow into giant trees.

                <h3>Maranta Leuconeura</h3>
                <p>
                    I know absolutely nothing about this plant but I thought the patterns on the leaves are cool. He surprised me the
                    first night in my apartment when his leaves shot straight up into the air and the next day they were droopy again.
                    I wondered if I was killing it somehow but after a Google search I found out this strange being is called the prayer
                    plant for good reason.

        <h2>Circus Arts</h2>
        <p>
            The thing that brings me the most joy in my life is my Circus movement journey. My favorite apperatus is Lyra although
            I am now learning Trapeze and I plan to keep expanding my skills in many areas. If I'm not practice coding or with my partner, 
            I'm at the studio or planning my next performance. I performed my first competition in June and placed first in my catagory.
            This art form has changed my life for the better.
